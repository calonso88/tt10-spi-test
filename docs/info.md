## How it works

SPI test design based from https://github.com/calonso88/tt07_alu_74181

It has been configured with 2 read/write 8 bit registers and 2 read only 8 bit status registers.

The first read/write register also drives the 7 segment display.

## How to test

See https://github.com/calonso88/tt07_alu_74181

Write to the first register to set the LEDs on the demoboard.

## External hardware

Nothing required
